# Efficiency Code of Conduct
## Pledge 
We create this Code of Conduct in an effort to welcome contributors, make them feel safe and respected, and be friendly to them.
No matter who they are, they deserve to be treated like this.
Anyone is free to use this Code of Conduct and edit it. Collaborators on any of these repositories can further expand on this [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct] in separate files. If collaborators will want to edit this Code of Conduct for any reason, they must do it in a fork of the [Code of Conduct's repository][code-of-conduct], or change the header "Efficiency Code of Conduct" to a new name and declare the Code of Conduct that name instead. This copy, if not declared a different one, of the Code of Conduct must be accepted to be put into this template Code of Conduct.
## Expectations
You must follow this repository's [Contributing guidelines][contributing] in addition to this [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct].
Retaliation is not allowed. Please go [here][reporting] to learn how to report them instead. 
## Acceptable Behavior
- Greeting new contributors 
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Communicating in a friendly manner
- Focusing on the project 
- Creating issues and pull requests 
- Showing empathy toward other contributors
- Reminding others of these guidelines and other rules
## Unacceptable Behavior
- Harassment of others whether in public or private for any reason
- Sexual images or language and unwelcome sexual attention/advances
- Publishing or sending others' private information, like an address or age, without their explicit permission without **any** type of forcing them
- Trolling
- Cussing
- Anything you wouldn't show in a formal setting, like in front of your boss or teacher (NSFW)
- Derogatory "jokes" (including threatening to violate these guidelines but not actually/quasi-threatening)
## Reporting
Any unacceptable behavior should be reported as follows, and retaliation will result in both parties being punished in the ways shown in the preceding section after this one.
*These specifications for reporting are here for a reason and must be added to your report. If you don't, we might reject action on the report until we hear more from you.*
**If you aren't a maintainer or above:**
Email as aforementioned. Some recommendations are below, along with a template for you to use.
- Explain the problem in professional words, not just vaguely because you know what happened. Otherwise, your report will probably leave the perpetrator unscathed.
- Don't go astray from what you're reporting. Linking a billion other links to your fancy websites or saying stuff like "LOL" or "Blah, blah, blah" doesn't help anyone review your report.
- Don't act as if someone not in @efficiency-org/communications-and-contributing-department could possibly review your report morally and without violating our guidelines.
- Don't be direct or derogatory. This includes stuff like "You better not be dilatory this time!" or "Hey you, one of those idiots reading my report!"; obviously.
- Don't just assume stuff or just answer one inane question. Write it lengthy! We can still read it; organizations work like this!
- We're not officially copyrighted. Don't try looking for our physical company establishment. Just, don't, please.
- If you're stuck, just use the template below!
- If you act derogatory to your perpetrator, verdict says, you'll be punished as well.
- GitHub is not a lawyer, and we aren't, either. We're just an organization via GitHub!
- Please don't close your report - you should check it in case we prompt you. We urgently value your report!

  <summary>Template</summary>
  My problem:
  (EX: https://github.com/SomeGitHubUser spread spamming and was derogatory. Then, they just swore and didn't evoke themself.)
  What I've tried:
  (EX: Warning them about violating the guidelines, but they just proceeded more aggressively. Trying to tone down the heated violation didn't have any avail, either.)
  What you can do:
  (EX: Try assessing the problem, perhaps punishing them if the perpetrating proceeds.)
  Don't fill this out:
  (EX: )
  I didn't fill that out:
  (EX: Yes, of course! I oblige!)

**If you ARE a maintainer or above:**
Report the issue to the Slack instance **immediately**. If you are a part of @efficiency-org/report-reviewers, also review any reports that have been submitted. Ask for assistance from @efficiency-org/communications-and-contributing-department if necessary, even if you're a part of it to recruit more help! Finally, take action as necessary.
## Enforcement
**For reports:**
If a user isn't mentioned in the "My problem" section, we will immediately respond with a prompt for more information. Please respond to this as quickly as you can.
It will be the same for everything else.
If you did something wrong with "Don't fill this out" or "I didn't fill that out", we will respond to you warning you to oblige to us. You'll never be punished for this, but it's a good note to have.
Here are our enforcement levels:
- Level 1: Minor first offense, minor (misorganizing, mentioning one or two more times than preferred, etc.), accidents, etc.: Warning via reply
- Level 2: Posting a few posts with ALL CAPS, using potentially sensitive words (e.g. "hate", "love", "date", etc.): Warning via reply & edit
- Level 3: Polictical or unsettling terms, hate speech, slurs, discrimination, swearing, etc.: Warning via reply, delete, & demotion
- Level 4: Spamming, super mass-pinging, postfarming, lots of low-effort postings, violations of license/TOSes, etc.: Warning via reply, delete, demotion, & block from organization
