# Efficiency Code of Conduct
## Pledge 
We create this Code of Conduct in an effort to welcome contributors, make them feel safe and respected, and be friendly to them.
No matter who they are, they deserve to be treated like this.
Anyone is free to use this Code of Conduct and edit it. Collaborators on any of these repositories can further expand on this [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct] in separate files. If collaborators will want to edit this Code of Conduct for any reason, they must do it in a fork of the [Code of Conduct's repository][code-of-conduct], or change the header "Efficiency Code of Conduct" to a new name and declare the Code of Conduct that name instead. This copy, if not declared a different one, of the Code of Conduct must be accepted to be put into this template Code of Conduct.
## Expectations
You must follow this repository's [Contributing guidelines][contributing] in addition to this [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct].
Retaliation is not allowed. Please go [here][reporting] to learn how to report them instead.
